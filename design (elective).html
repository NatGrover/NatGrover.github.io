  <h1 class="new-color" id="the-one">Design Elective</h1>
  <p class="new-color">
    In my elective class, Design, we took science fiction and fantasy stories and created designs based on those. After
    reading the story "The Electric Ant" by Phillip Dick, I began developing ideas for futuristic surgical technology.

    <p>I drew inspiration from Da Vinci surgical robots when designing. These are my notes on the machines.</p>

    <p>This was the design for an improved Da Vinci I created. The control component comes in later, but the essential
      idea is that the technician/surgeon can control snake like arms duing a surgery, eliminating the issue of bulky
      and inconvenient arms in the version we have now.</p>

  <section class="standard-box box">
    <p>This design is for a visual aid unit to pair with the Da Vinci system. The goggles are used as VR so one can
      immerse themselves in the procedure, much like the modern Da Vinci.</p>

  <section class="standard-box box">
    <p>The glove design is meant to act as the interface for the Da Vinci. The numerous sensors and wireless connection
      components work together to create a well calibrated, accurate, and comfortable interface for the practitioner.

    <p>These last three photos document the journey to my final deaign for a hand prosthesis, as I chose to go in a
      different direction from the Da Vinci. The hand design was too organic in the beginning, so it was edited to
      better suit technology and practicality versus biological accuracy. The last photo documents my plan for lathing
      out the pieces of the finished product.</p>
