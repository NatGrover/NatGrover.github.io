    This is a gathering of some of my best projects from my digital 1 class
  </p>

  <h2>Project 1</h2>
  <h4>Color Theory - Triadic</h4>
  <a href="index.html"><img src="img/20200817-GroverNatalieDigital1-TrickoftheEye(s)-Final-Submission.jpg"></a>
  <p>In this project, we chose specific color schemes using Adobe Color, and created artworks based on those. In this
    piece I used a triadic color scheme of yellow, cyan, and magenta, and created a creepy digital piece</p>

  <h2>Project 2</h2>
  <h4>Photo Editing and Atmospheric Perspective</h4>
  <a href="index.html"><img src="img/heheheheh.jpg"></a>
  <p>In this project, we had to take photographs and edit them in a manner that created atmospheric perspective. I made
    another creepy and entertaining piece, inwhich a larger version of me is hunting myself. Using the burn and add
    tools in photoshop helped to really bring my idea to life.</p>

  <h2>Project 4</h2>
  <h4>Self Expression</h4>
  <a href="index.html"><img src="img/20200921GroverNatalie_project4_digital1.jpg"></a>
  <p>In this project, we were to use photos and digital painting to create a piece that expresses who we are. I drew
    characters from my favorite childhood videogames alongside a picture of myself, heading towards one of the most
    peaceful scenes from my favorite videogame. I feel that the characters, scene, and photography, coe together to show
    how I've grown with these game.</p>
