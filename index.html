    <p>For our last project in Digital 1, we were meant to create a piece with both vector and raster based images that
        highlight our time during this semester. I started drawing these lil mushroom guys a little while ago, and
        they've been my doodble buddies for the time. During this semester, especially because of covid, I've been
        appreciating the outdoors more and more. I wanted to incorporate nature and my lil fungi friends, which have
        grown along with me this semester.</p>
