  <p class="new-color">My Intended Major</p>

  <p style="color: aliceblue;">My intended major in college is Industrial Design. The profession is essentially the
    creation of product ideas
    based on things like aesthetic, the consumer, social, and commercial attitudes. I want to work in this field, as I
    used to be a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics student. Within the STEM curriculum, the projects and
    solutions were stiff, forced and unimaginitive. I wanted to do something different than what my teachers presented
    me. My father informed me of the profession, and took me to an Industrial Design firm so I could learn more about
    it. I became fascinated immediately. The projects they showed that really could do something, make a mark of some
    form, inspired me to pursue the profession. I'm very excited to enter my major next year!</p>
